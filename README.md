## Store Proxy

A protoype for calculating distances between two zipcodes. Only the backend exists so far, a dummy json file is used as a DB until an actual MySQL DB is built. All results appear in the console. 

Uses two different zipcode API's (limited requests can be made which has made testing difficult).

*API keys are commented out, the two API's use different queries*

Needs sorting by distance worked on.
